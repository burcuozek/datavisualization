# Data Visualization Techniques

Data visualization is a crucial step in understanding the data. It is a graphical representation of information and data. Using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.


In this project, detailed data cleaning and data exploration steps are conducted. Then various data visualization techniques are used to explain the data better (ordered bar plots, stacked bar charts, density plots, summary tables, heat maps, line plots, and more). The following data sets are being used.
